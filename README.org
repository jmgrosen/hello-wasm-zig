* hello wasm

a little shootout between Zig / WASM and JS

run in Chrome (Safari won't let you use =performance.now=
without trickery that is beyond me)
by, e.g. serving to localhost

#+begin_src bash
python3 -m http.server
#+end_src

compile the wasm from source by downloading [[https://ziglang.org][Zig]] (tested with version 0.12.0)
and running

#+begin_src bash
zig build-exe src/main.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -fno-entry -OReleaseFast --export=trianglePTR
#+end_src

you can alter the parameters of the shootout in =test.js=, for example the number of samples,
the number of iterations, the frequency, phase input, sample rate, etc.

the function TrianglePTR is an implementation of the Polynomial Transition Region anti-aliasing algorithm to generate an asymmetric triangle wave.
